Fill a folder with theoretically infinite amounts of cheese with this simple program!

## How to use:

1. Download cheese.py from the releases page and place it in the folder you wish to fill.
2. Once placed in a folder, open the folder in your terminal.
3. Finally, run the file using ```python cheese.py``` or ```python3 cheese.py```

I am *NOT* responsible for any damage this may cause to your PC; this is just a fun program I made since I am very new to Python.
